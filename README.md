  <p><em>Revolutionizing the way students learn from YouTube</em></p>
</div>



## 🌟 Inspiration
Exams are about to come in a month and you are watching countless educational videos on YouTube, feeling productive and prepared. But then, exam week arrives, and the real challenge begins—revision. You think to yourself, "How am I going to review all these videos in time?"

Your options?<br/>
1️⃣ Pause every few seconds to jot down notes—tedious and time-consuming.<br/>
2️⃣ Screenshot key moments, paste them into a Word document, and scramble to add context—frustrating, right?<br/>
3️⃣ Spend hours organizing everything instead of actually revising.<br/>
<br/>

And then, just when you need clarity the most, a doubt pops up about a concept or explanation. **You wish you could directly ask the tutor in the video, "Can you explain that part again?"**

What if there was a better way?
What if you could:

Watch videos, take snapshots of important moments, and instantly get a clean, organized PDF—complete with timestamps and all your notes?
Ask questions directly about the video and get detailed, timestamped answers from an AI-powered tutor simulating the expertise of the instructor?
That’s exactly why we created Study Tube: a tool that takes the effort out of revision and provides quick doubt resolution, so you can focus on what matters most—learning and acing your exams!

- 📂 **Playlist Notes**: Combine notes from entire playlists into one organized PDF, reducing clutter.
