  <p><em>Revolutionizing the way students learn from YouTube</em></p>
</div>



## 🌟 Inspiration
Exams are about to come in a month and you are watching countless educational videos on YouTube, feeling productive and prepared. But then, exam week arrives, and the real challenge begins—revision. You think to yourself, "How am I going to review all these videos in time?"

Your options?<br/>
1️⃣ Pause every few seconds to jot down notes—tedious and time-consuming.<br/>
2️⃣ Screenshot key moments, paste them into a Word document, and scramble to add context—frustrating, right?<br/>
3️⃣ Spend hours organizing everything instead of actually revising.<br/>
<br/>

And then, just when you need clarity the most, a doubt pops up about a concept or explanation. **You wish you could directly ask the tutor in the video, "Can you explain that part again?"**

What if there was a better way?
What if you could:

Watch videos, take snapshots of important moments, and instantly get a clean, organized PDF—complete with timestamps and all your notes?
Ask questions directly about the video and get detailed, timestamped answers from an AI-powered tutor simulating the expertise of the instructor?
That’s exactly why we created Study Tube: a tool that takes the effort out of revision and provides quick doubt resolution, so you can focus on what matters most—learning and acing your exams!

## 🚀 What it does  
StudyTube is a Chrome extension designed to revolutionize the way students engage with YouTube educational content. It offers:  
- ✍️ **Timestamped Notes**: Take snapshots of video moments with timestamps while watching. These are compiled into a PDF where each snapshot is clickable, taking you back to the exact video moment.  
- 📂 **Playlist Notes**: Combine notes from entire playlists into one organized PDF, reducing clutter.  
- 🤖 **AI-Powered Assistance**: Summarize videos, clarify doubts, and get detailed explanations with AI responses that include timestamps.

## 🌍 Civic Auth (Web3) Impact

**1. Educational Equity**
By integrating Civic Auth Web3’s embedded wallet system, StudyTube ensures frictionless access to blockchain-powered educational tools—regardless of students’ technical background—making high-quality learning more accessible to everyone.

**2. Digital Literacy**
Embedding Web3 wallets with Civic Auth exposes students to decentralized identity and Web3 concepts in a seamless way, enhancing their digital literacy and confidence with emerging technologies.

**3. Academic Success**
Streamlined authentication and onboarding reduce technical barriers and cognitive load, allowing learners to focus on their studies rather than setup processes—boosting motivation and outcomes.


## 🛠️ Technical Implementation  
- **Frontend**: Chrome extension UI built with React and Tailwind CSS and Website with Next js
- **Authentication**: Civic Auth Web3
- **AI Integration**: Gemini and Pinecone for vector search
- **Storage**: Chrome extension storage and Supabase for saving notes and preferences
- **PDF Generation**: React PDF library for creating study materials  

## 🏆 Why StudyTube Stands Out  
Unlike other note-taking extensions, StudyTube:  
- Deeply integrates with YouTube's learning ecosystem  
- Provides AI that understands educational context  
- Creates actionable study materials from passive watching  
- Works completely offline for uninterrupted learning  

## 🚀 Future Roadmap  
- Mobile app version for on-the-go learning  
- Collaborative study features  
- Integration with learning management systems  
- Advanced analytics for tracking learning progress
