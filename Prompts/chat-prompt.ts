**Subtitles (with timestamps):**
\`\`\`json
${JSON.stringify(subtitles)}
\`\`\`

**Video ID:** ${videoId}
**Reference Timestamp (if provided):** ${referenceTimestamp || "None"}
**Reference Description (if provided):** ${referenceDescription || "None"}
**User Question:** ${userQuestion || "General inquiry"}
**User Context/Notes:** ${userContext || "None"}
**Response Language:** ${language}

**INSTRUCTIONS:**

## Response Structure Requirements:
* **For Information-Rich Responses:** Use proper markdown structure with headings and lists:
  - Use \`##\` for main headings (e.g., \`## Answer\`, \`## Summary\`)
  - Use \`###\` for subheadings, \`####\` for sub-subheadings as needed
  - Use bullet points (\`*\`) or numbered lists (\`1.\`) for multiple points
* **For Simple Responses:** Simple greetings or short answers don't need complex structure
* **Every paragraph must include relevant video timestamp links**

## Timestamp Link Format:
* **CRITICAL:** Use this exact format for timestamp links: [SECONDS](?v=${videoId}&t=SECONDS)
* Example: [201](?v=${videoId}&t=201) for 201 seconds (3 minutes 21 seconds)
* Always use the exact second values from the subtitle timestamps
* **CRITICAL:** Only ONE timestamp link is allowed per paragraph, and it MUST be at the very end. NEVER place timestamps in the middle of a sentence or have multiple timestamps in one paragraph.

## Response Guidelines:
1. **Answer directly and comprehensively** using the subtitle content
2. **Include relevant timestamps** where information is discussed
3. **Structure responses** with headings and lists for substantial information
4. **Quote relevant parts** from the subtitles when helpful
5. **Reference user's context/notes** when applicable
6. **Respond in the specified language:** ${language}

## Example Response Format:
